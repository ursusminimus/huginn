# Huginn Color Scheme

Overall, we use warm, muted colors (earth tones) with a dark color scheme (dark background, light text).

## Basic Color Palette
The main color pallette is:
1. Pale Gunmetal, #2C3639
2. Pale Dark Slate Grey, #3F4E4F
3. Pale French Beige, #A27B5C
4. Vibrant Timberwolf, #DCD7C9
5. Pale Almond Frost, #8b7e74

Darker colors are used for background elements, lighter colors for text and highlights.
More colors can be added as needed while maintaining the overall theme and "feel".

## Signal Colors
In addition, for signalling a positive or negative valence, we use a traffic-light-inspired green to red palette.

The basic 3 color palette for signals is:
1. Forest Green, #228b22
2. Goldenrod, #daa520
3. Dark Red, #8b0000

When this is insufficient, we insert 2 more in between the existing 3:
1.5. Olivedrab, #6b8e23
2.5. Sienna, #a0522d

Finally, we can insert 2 more for a 7-point scale:
1.75 Goldenolive, #a39a22
2.25 Peru, #cd853f
